# Deployment
The website uses Github pages. The flow is that we run `quarto render` in a local dev environment once we're happy with our changes. Those files are stored in a ./docs folder which then Github has configured to deploy on the `master` branch under the `docs` folder.

For emailing in Forms we use formsubmit.co This is a risk as they are small and may go out of business but we can revise that in the future.
