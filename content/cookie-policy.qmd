## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the website owners.

## How We Use Cookies

Kudoo uses cookies for several purposes, including:

### Essential Cookies

These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly and cannot be disabled in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions you take such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.

### Performance and Analytics Cookies

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.

We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous information about how you use our website. Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, and what you click on. We do not collect or store your personal information (e.g., your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.

### Functional Cookies

These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.

### Targeting and Advertising Cookies

These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites.

## Managing Your Cookie Preferences

Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org).

You can choose to reject or block all or specific types of cookies set by our website by clicking on the cookie settings at the bottom of any page.

Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.

## Google Analytics Opt-Out

To provide website visitors with more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics.

If you want to opt out, download and install the add-on for your web browser here: [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Changes to This Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Cookie Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
