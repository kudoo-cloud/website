**Early Access Feature Release: Streamline Your Policy Management with Automated Document Workflows**
:::

At Kudoo, we understand that implementing ISO 27001 involves more than just creating policiesâ€”it requires a systematic approach to document management, review, approval, and version control. Today, we're excited to announce a powerful new addition to our Microsoft-integrated compliance platform: **Automated SharePoint Document Management for ISO 27001**.

## The Document Management Challenge

If you're implementing ISO 27001, you're likely familiar with these challenges:

- Creating consistent, compliant policy documents across your organization
- Tracking which stakeholders need to review and approve each document
- Managing the signature collection process across multiple departments
- Maintaining proper version control for audit purposes
- Ensuring the right people have access to the right documents

Our existing Kudoo Copilot app has already transformed how organizations create ISO-compliant templates. Now, we're extending that capability with end-to-end document lifecycle management within your Microsoft environment.

## Introducing Automated SharePoint Integration

Our new SharePoint integration creates a seamless document workflow that takes your policies from creation to approval with minimal manual intervention:

1. **Automated Site Creation** - Kudoo creates a dedicated SharePoint site with a structured folder system specifically designed for ISO 27001 documentation
2. **Template Customization** - Your organization's details are automatically populated across all required ISO templates
3. **Document Routing** - Policies are intelligently routed to the appropriate stakeholders for review
4. **Digital Signatures** - Integrated DocuSign functionality streamlines the approval process
5. **Automated Version Control** - Documents are systematically managed with proper versioning in SharePoint

All of this happens within your existing Microsoft environment, eliminating the need to adopt yet another compliance platform.

## How It Works

The integration process is straightforward:

1. **Simple Setup** - Deploy an Entra app with machine-to-machine access to Kudoo
2. **One-Click Initialization** - Call our API endpoint with your organization's details
3. **Automated Provisioning** - Kudoo creates your compliance SharePoint site with all required folders
4. **Template Generation** - All required ISO policies are created and populated with your organization's information
5. **Signature Workflow** - Documents are routed to appropriate stakeholders via DocuSign
6. **Organized Storage** - Signed documents are automatically stored with proper version control

This process transforms document management from a manual, error-prone task into a streamlined, automated workflow that enhances both efficiency and compliance.

- **Simplified Compliance** - Maintain audit-ready documentation with automatic versioning
